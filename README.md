# BreastCancerProject
This is a Breast Cancer Data Set with 286 instances of real patient data obtained from the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana. The data set is publicly available from UCI Machine Learning repository and has the following variables:  Age: age of the patient at the time of diagnosis;  Menopause: whether the patient is pre- or postmenopausal at time of diagnosis;  Tumor size: the greatest diameter (in mm) of the excised tumor;  Inv-nodes: the number (range 0 - 39) of axillary lymph nodes that contain metastatic breast cancer visible on histological examination;  Node caps: if the cancer does metastasise to a lymph node, although outside the original site of the tumor it may remain “contained” by the capsule of the lymph node. However, over time, and with more aggressive disease, the tumor may replace the lymph node and then penetrate the capsule, allowing it to invade the surrounding tissues;  Degree of malignancy: the histological grade (range 1-3) of the tumor. Tumors that are grade 1 predominantly consist of cells that, while neoplastic, retain many of their usual characteristics. Grade 3 tumors predominately consist of cells that are highly abnormal;  Breast: breast cancer may obviously occur in either breast;  Breast quadrant: the breast may be divided into four quadrants, using the nipple as a central point;  Irradiation: radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells.
